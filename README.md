# Terraform project with static website

This project is designed to demonstrate how to set up automated static website hosting on AWS using Terraform. The project uses an S3 bucket to host a static HTML website generated by ChatGPT.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials.

## Project Structure

── main.tf
── provider.tf
── variables.tf
── outputs.tf
── index.html # Static HTML site generated by ChatGPT
── style.css
── README.md # This documentation

## How to Use

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   
2. Navigate to the terraform directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd terraform

3. Initialize Terraform.

   ```bash
   terraform init

4. Configure the necessary variables in variables.tf if needed, such as AWS region and S3 bucket name.

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure.

   ```bash
   terraform apply

6. Once Terraform completes, it will output the website URL. Access the URL in your web browser to view the static website.

7. To destroy the infrastructure when you're finished, use:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy

## Additional Notes

The index.html file in the project root contains the static HTML site generated by ChatGPT. You can customize this file as needed.

Be cautious when deploying infrastructure in your AWS account to avoid unexpected costs.
